/*
Exercise 1: How could you rewrite gpa >= 2.0 in the first if statement using
the NOT operator?
Exercise 2: Could you replace year !='4' in the else if statement with
year < 4 or year <= 3? Why or why not?
Exercise 3: If you replace
if ( gpa >= 2.0 && year == '4')
with
if ( gpa >= 2.0 || year == '4')
and replace
else if ( year != '4'|| gpa < 2.0)
with
else if ( year != '4' && gpa < 2.0)
which students will graduate and which will not graduate according to this
new program?
Does this handle all cases (i.e., all combinations of year and gpa)?
Exercise 4: Could you replace else if ( year != '4'|| gpa < 2.0) with the
single word else?
